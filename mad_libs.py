Once upon a time, there was a {adjective} {noun1} who loved to {verb1} all day.
One day, {noun2} walked into the room and caught the {noun1} in the act. 
{noun2}: "What are you doing?"
{noun1}: "I'm just {verb1}ing, what's the big deal?"
{noun2}: "Well, it's not every day that you see a {noun1} {verb1}ing in the middle of the day."
{noun1}: "I guess you're right. Maybe I should take a break."
{noun2}: "That's probably a good idea. Why don't we go {verb2} instead?"
{noun1}: "Sure, that sounds like fun!"

And so, {noun2} and the {noun1} went off to {verb2} and had a great time. 
The end.
